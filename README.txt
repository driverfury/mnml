# MNML

This is an emulator made from scratch in C inspired by [Slu4](https://github.com/slu4coder)'s YouTube [series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYlQj5cfIcBU5SqFe6Uz4Q31_6VZyZ8h5).

The goal is to write an emulator (based on [Simplest CPU](https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-UART-CPU-System)) from scratch in C.

A toolchain will be built: assembler, compiler of our own C-like language, OS and so on.
